# Advent of Code
These are my C# solutions to the puzzles on https://adventofcode.com (not mine).

My goals were to complete them without external libraries and have fun along the way.

## Progress
Not every year is completed yet, the majority is still skeleton template.
Perhaps during future events I'll revisit some of the worst performing solutions.

- My first year was 2024, started on December 2nd 2024, completed on December 29th 2024.
  - I did not have git running until the end to have a good record of which days I struggled with.
  - Looking at personal leaderboard, Part 2's that took over 24 hours were days: 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
  - Day 21 had the worst Part 1 experience for me, but was definitely the funniest to read.
  - Day 22 Part 2 has the worst runtime length.
  - Day 23 I had noted down as being difficult for me to comprehend in general.
- 2015 was started on December 8th 2024 and completed on December 31st 2024.
- 2016 was started on December 31st 2014 and completed on January 8th 2025.
- 2017 was started on January 8th 2025 and completed on January 14th 2025.
- 2018 was started on January 15th 2025, and completed on March 25th 2025.
  - Day 15 was super evil, I didn't get an accepted answer for over a week.
  - Day 17 looks innocent but compounded feelings of defeat in me, it was put on pause for over a month before revisiting from scratch.
  - Day 19 was after the hiatus, and math did not make me feel any better about returning without help.
  - Day 21 has the worst runtime length.
  - Day 22 was the second last completed, it had a lot of back and forth with code changes and website answer attempts. Suspect there's something still wrong with the code for other inputs.
  - Day 23 was more math that was beyond my abilities without help.
- 2019 was started on Febuary 5th 2025 to distract myself from 2018, was taking it slow, completed on March 15th 2025.
  - Day 16 I could not optimize without help.
  - Day 18 was the last puzzle completed, it took a few days to optimize enough to get an answer.
  - Day 21 isn't truely solved as it has baked in shortcut for my input.
  - Day 22 required math knowledge that I would never be able to work out on my own.
  - Day 25 I didn't make solving automatic, but it was fun making the game playable and getting to the answer.
- 2020 was started on March 26th 2025, and completed on May 11th 2025.
  - Day 10 took a while to get rolling.
  - Day 17 performs terribly. It took me a while because the similarity to 2019 Day 24 threw me off when it came to a key difference.
  - Day 19 is evil. My fault for avoiding regex for so long when I already had the pattern most of the way there.
  - Day 20 is nuts, while it took a few days it was my favourite puzzle of this year.
- 2021 was started on May 11th 2025.
  - Day 8 needed sleep to realise how to approach it.
  - Day 15 took time failing to reuse 2024 pathfinding until landing on reusing 2018 Day 22.
  - Day 18 was very difficult and unfortunately doesn't make use of special structure for solving part of it.
  - Day 21 was a huge demotivator.
  - Day 22 was really difficult and also around the time I was sick.
  - Day 23 still needs to be optimised.
  - Day 24 took me forever for various silly reasons.

## Additional notes
As per rules on Advent of Code's website: inputs and puzzle text (except titles) are not included in this repo.

Each year's project should also have two folders (**Input** and **Test**) containing text files (**01.txt** to **25.txt**). The template zip file contains blanks.

The answers to my inputs *are* included as comments, while useless to others simply because it's a pattern I started early on.

Some of the solutions have leftover visualisation or interactive code. I never settled on a convention to enable these so some are: variable change, uncommenting, certain console input. Potential revisit idea for a future event.
