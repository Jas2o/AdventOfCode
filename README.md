# Advent of Code
These are my C# solutions to the puzzles on https://adventofcode.com (not mine).

My goals were to complete them without external libraries and have fun along the way.

## Progress
Not every year is completed yet, the majority is still skeleton template.
Perhaps during future events I'll revisit some of the worst performing solutions.

- My first year was 2024, started on December 2nd 2024, completed on December 29th 2024.
  - I did not have git running until the end to have a good record of which days I struggled with.
  - Looking at personal leaderboard, Part 2's that took over 24 hours were days: 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24.
  - Day 21 had the worst Part 1 experience for me, but was definitely the funniest to read.
  - Day 22 Part 2 has the worst runtime length.
  - Day 23 I had noted down as being difficult for me to comprehend in general.
- 2015 was started on December 8th 2024 and completed on December 31st 2024.
- 2016 was started on December 31st 2014 and completed on January 8th 2025.
- 2017 was started on January 8th 2025 and completed on January 14th 2025.
- 2018 was started on January 15th 2025, is currently paused on Day 17.
  - It was on January 19th 2025 that **Day 15 ruined my life**, easily the most evil puzzle I have encounted so far and completely killed my drive to work on puzzles daily.
- 2019 was started on Febuary 5th 2025 to distract myself from 2018, was taking it slow, completed on March 15th 2025.

## Additional notes
As per rules on Advent of Code's website: inputs and puzzle text (except titles) are not included in this repo.

Each year's project should also have two folders (**Input** and **Test**) containing text files (**01.txt** to **25.txt**). The template zip file contains blanks.

The answers to my inputs *are* included as comments, while useless to others simply because it's a pattern I started early on.

Some of the solutions have leftover visualisation or interactive code. I never settled on a convention to enable these so some are: variable change, uncommenting, certain console input. Potential revisit idea for a future event.
